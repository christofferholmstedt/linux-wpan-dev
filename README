linux-wpan development tools for Raspberry Pi
=============================================
This repository includes my scripts for compiling linux kernel development
branch/repository "bluetooth-next" HEAD for Raspberry Pi.

### Best documentation is running code
The main goal with this repository is to maintain a few scripts that make the
process of compiling the latest bluetooth-next kernel as easy as possible as
well as configuring the Raspberry Pis when they boot up.

### Scripts
If you don't know what Vagrant is nor care to learn you can just skip all
vagrant files and head straight for the "scripts" folder. All scripts are made
for Ubuntu and tested on Ubuntu Trusty Tahr 14.04.2.

	- download_prerequisites.sh
	Run this script first to clone (with git) both the bluetooth-next
	repository and the U-Boot repository from @swarren.

### Vagrant
Prerequisites: Vagrant and Virtualbox.

In this git repository Vagrant is configured to boot up a Ubuntu 14.04 VM in
Virtualbox, update and upgrade as well as installing required build tools for
building the linux-kernel. The provisioning scripts do _not_ download nor
build/compile the linux-kernel or U-Boot. You have to do that yourself:

	1 vagrant up
	2 vagrant ssh
	3 sudo ./host/scripts/download_prerequisites.sh
